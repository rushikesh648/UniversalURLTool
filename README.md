# Universal URL Tool

A comprehensive Python utility for parsing, validating, constructing, and generating connection strings from URLs. This tool leverages Python's powerful `urllib.parse` module to provide robust URL manipulation capabilities.

## Features

-   **URL Component Extraction:** Break down any URL into its fundamental parts (scheme, hostname, port, path, query parameters, fragment).
-   **URL Validation:** Basic validation to check if a string conforms to a standard URL format.
-   **URL Construction:** Build URLs programmatically from individual components.
-   **Connection String Generation:** Generate configurable connection strings from parsed URL components, useful for database connections, API clients, or environment variables.
-   **Path/Directory Breakdown:** Understand the hierarchical structure of a URL's path.
